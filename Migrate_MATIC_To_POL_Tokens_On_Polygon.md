MATIC tokens were essential to the early success of Polygon. However, with the upcoming POL upgrade, MATIC tokens will** no longer be compatible** with dApps and exchanges. It’s important for everyone to migrate their existing MATIC tokens to the new POL tokens to ensure continued functionality.
POL tokens can be migrated at a **1:1 ratio** from existing MATIC tokens using a migration contract. This means that anyone who holds MATIC tokens can send MATIC tokens to **the migration contract** and will receive the same amount of POL tokens. There is no reduction in the token supply.

## For all users who are currently staking MATIC tokens:
The upgrade process will not automatically migrate staked MATIC to POL. You must first unstake your tokens, complete the migration, and then restake the new POL tokens. This ensures that your staking rewards continue seamlessly with the upgraded POL tokens. Don’t miss this crucial step to secure your assets and stay updated with the latest network changes.
## How to Migrate MATIC Tokens to POL Tokens?
Migration smart contracts, created for migration purposes, allow users to migrate MATIC tokens safely **without having to connect** to any external platforms. 
The migration smart contracts are **open-source**, meaning the code can be checked by anyone interested in how the migration works.

The migration of MATIC tokens can be performed **from any blockchain**, except Polygon, where the migration has already happened automatically. Since all MATIC tokens are EVM-compatible, the migration contracts work seamlessly across all blockchains where MATIC tokens are available, including Polygon zkEVM, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Harmony, Moonriver, Moonbeam, and Energi.

Using a migration contract only requires users to **pay the gas fee**. This means that every user who wants to perform the migration needs to have native tokens in their wallet. For the Ethereum network, the native token is ETH, for Binance Smart Chain it is BNB, etc.

Migration is a similar process to any other transaction, and the gas fees are minimal. We recommend choosing the recommended (normal) gas fee while sending MATIC tokens to the migration contract. 

The migration can be conducted with **any wallet** you usually use to access the MATIC tokens. All wallets support the migration process.

To perform the migration, send your MATIC tokens to the migration smart contract address: `0xb0DBfcE851b0c79F51B7a9F0E8ed959eAFa60D61`. 

For the amount, choose to send **the entire balance**. The migration contract will remain in a waiting state until the entire balance is sent.
Once the transaction is confirmed and broadcasted to the blockchain, the migration process will begin. Your MATIC tokens will be burned, and your wallet will **automatically be credited** with POL tokens. Depending on the blockchain congestion, it may take **1–10 minutes** for the POL tokens to appear in your wallet. The POL tokens will be linked to the same private key and seed as the wallet that initiated the migration.

Congratulations - you’ve successfully completed the migration! You can now be confident that you hold the **latest POL tokens**.
